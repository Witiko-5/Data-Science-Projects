    "#### Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "An opinion poll team, [FiveThirtyEight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FiveThirtyEight), asked the question: **does the rest of America realize that \"The Empire Strikes Back\" is clearly the best of the bunch?** In order to answer this question the team created a survery from SurveyMonkey which recieved 835 respones total, which you can download from [their github repository](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/star-wars-survey).\n",
    "\n",
    "With the data we're analyzing there are several columns containing answers to single questions about *Star Wars* movies. Meaning that for some questions the respondent had to check one or more boxes. Because of these the formatting of our data is a bit strange so there is going to be a lot of data restructuring in this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Dictionary:\n",
    "\n",
    " - `RespondentID` - An anonymized ID for the respondent (person taking the survey)\n",
    " - `Gender` - the respondent's gender\n",
    " - `Age` - the respondent's age\n",
    " - `Household Income` -  the respondent's income\n",
    " - `Education` - the respondent's education level\n",
    " - `Location (Census Region)` - the respondent's location\n",
    " - `Have you seen any of the 6 films in the Star Wars franchise?` - a Yes or No response\n",
    " - `Do you consider yourself to be a fan of the Star Wars film franchise?` - a Yes or No response\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Summary of Results:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `The Empire Strikes Back (Ep. 5)` is the highest rated and most viewed across the board\n",
    "- `Revenge of the Sith (Ep. 3)` is the leasted rated and leasted viewed across the board\n",
    "- Every Star Wars movie had approximately 70 more males than females watch said film\n",
