    "An opinion poll team, [FiveThirtyEight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FiveThirtyEight), asked the question: **does the rest of America realize that \"The Empire Strikes Back\" is clearly the best of the bunch?** In order to answer this question the team created a survery from SurveyMonkey which recieved 835 respones total, which you can download from [their github repository].(https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/star-wars-survey)\n",
    "\n",
    "With the data we're analyzing there are several columns containing answers to single questions about *Star Wars* movies. Meaning that for some questions the respondent had to check one or more boxes. Because of these the formatting of our data is a bit strange so there is going to be a lot of data restructuring in this project.\n",
