    "#### Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "An opinion poll team, [FiveThirtyEight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FiveThirtyEight), asked the question: **does the rest of America realize that \"The Empire Strikes Back\" is clearly the best of the bunch?** In order to answer this question the team created a survery from SurveyMonkey which recieved 835 respones total, which you can download from [their github repository](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/star-wars-survey).\n",
    "\n",
    "With the data we're analyzing there are several columns containing answers to single questions about *Star Wars* movies. Meaning that for some questions the respondent had to check one or more boxes. Because of these the formatting of our data is a bit strange so there is going to be a lot of data restructuring in this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Dictionary:\n",
    "\n",
    " - `RespondentID` - An anonymized ID for the respondent (person taking the survey)\n",

    " - `Do you consider yourself to be a fan of the Star Wars film franchise?` - a Yes or No response\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Summary of Results:\n",
    "\n",

    "Looking at the movie ratings for Star Trek and Star Wars fans and non-fans shows that `The Phantom Menace (Ep. 1)`, `Attack of the Clones (Ep. 2)`, and `Revenge of the Sith (Ep. 3)` were all rated higher by non-fans of both film franchises where `A New Hope (Ep. 4)`, `The Empire Trikes Back (Ep. 5)`, and `Return of the Jedi (Ep. 6)` were rated higher by both Star Wars and Star Fans.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we can see that there is a higher view count is associated with Star Trek fans with all six movies compared to non-fans. This is true for not only Star Trek fans but Star Wars fans. Therefore it is safe to say that fans of Star Wars and Star Trek are more likely to watch future Star Wars movies and perhaps even other sci fi films similar to Star Wars and Star Trek.\n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "`The Empire Strikes Back (Ep. 5)` is the highest rated **and** most viewed movie across all the groups we analyzed (Gender, Star Wars fans, Star Trek fans) while `Revenge of the Sith (Ep. 3)` is the lowest rated **and** least viewed across all the same groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the first three Star Wars movies are all rated higher by non-Star Wars and non-Star Trek fans, while the last three are all rated higher by fans of both franchises.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, every Star Wars movie was viewed more by males than females, with the average viewing difference being approximately 70. I.e. There were 70 more males that watched each movie compared to females."
