As we can immediately see the Google Play store varies from the App Store in the fact that the percentages shown above are spread out amongst every genre -- even with the increased number of categories. However, we can still see some sort of  trend in fun-focused apps, even with this increased range of catgories to apps. We can see this in the family and games categories (as the family categories in Google Play is essentially just games focused for children)."
